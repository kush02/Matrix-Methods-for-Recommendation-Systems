# Matrix-Methods-for-Recommendation-Systems

This project explores the role and effectiveness of matrix decomposition methods in generating relevant movie recommendations. The MovieLens 100K dataset was used in this project and several neighborhood models (kNN) and low-rank matrix factorization models were cross-validated and implemented to assess performance. Finally, some theoretical extensions like applying spectral clustering to make recommendations were explored.
